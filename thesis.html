<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
<p><strong>Event processing</strong> is a method of tracking and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analytics'>analyzing</a> (processing) streams of information (data) about things that happen (events),[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-LuckhamD-1'>1]</a>and deriving a conclusion from them. <strong>Complex event processing</strong>, or <strong>CEP</strong>, is event processing that combines data from multiple sources[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-2'>2]</a> to infer events or patterns that suggest more complicated circumstances. The goal of complex event processing is to identify meaningful events (such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_opportunity'>opportunities</a> or threats)[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-Bates-3'>3]</a> and respond to them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>These events may be happening across the various layers of an organization as sales leads, orders or customer service calls. Or, they may be news items,[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-4'>4]</a> text messages, social media posts, stock market feeds, traffic reports, weather reports, or other kinds of data.[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-LuckhamD-1'>1]</a> An event may also be defined as a &quot;change of state,&quot; when a measurement exceeds a predefined threshold of time, temperature, or other value. Analysts suggest that CEP will give organizations a new way to analyze patterns in real-time and help the business side communicate better with IT and service departments.[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-5'>5]</a></p>
<p>The vast amount of information available about events is sometimes referred to as the event cloud.[<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing#cite_note-LuckhamD-1'>1]</a></p>
